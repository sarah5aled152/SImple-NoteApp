# Simple Note App

## Overview
The Simple Note App is a single-page application (SPA) that allows users to manage notes. Users can add, edit, and delete notes through a clean and user-friendly interface. This app uses vanilla JavaScript for functionality and demonstrates basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript integration.

## Features
1. **Add Notes**: Users can click the "Add Note" button to open a form where they can input a note title and description.
2. **Edit Notes**: Each note has an edit button, allowing users to modify the content.
3. **Delete Notes**: Each note also includes a delete button for easy removal.
4. **SPA Approach**: The app dynamically updates the DOM without page reloads.

## Folder Structure
```

```

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Install **JSON Server** globally if you havenâ€™t already:
   ```bash
   npm install -g json-server
   ```
3. Create a `db.json` file in your project folder with the following structure:
   ```json
   {
     "notes": [
       {
         "id": 1,
         "title": "Sample Note",
         "description": "This is a sample note."
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
4. Start the JSON Server:
   ```bash
   json-server --watch db.json
   ```
5. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Files
### **1. index.html**
Contains the structure of the app, including the Add Note button, the note form, and placeholders for notes.
